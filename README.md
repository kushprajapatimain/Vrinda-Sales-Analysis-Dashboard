## 🛑 Problem Statement
Vrinda Store lacked a consolidated view of its sales performance, customer behavior, and channel effectiveness in 2022.  
The business faced the following challenges:

- Difficulty comparing overall **sales and orders** trends across months.  
- Uncertainty about which **month, state, or product category** contributed the most to revenue.

- No clear understanding of **sales channel performance** and order statuses.  
- Challenges in identifying **top-performing segments** to optimize marketing and increase ROI.

This project addresses these gaps by performing structured data analysis and building an **interactive Excel dashboard**, enabling the business to make **data-driven decisions**, target profitable segments, and improve overall sales performance.
